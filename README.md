# Coins-on-a-star
The object of this puzzle is to place the largest possible number of coins at points of the
eight-pointed star depicted in Figure 2.9. The coins should be placed one after another, with 
the following restrictions: (i) a coin needs to be placed first on an unoccupied point and then
moved along a line to another unoccupied point, and (ii) once a coin has been positioned in this manner, 
it cannot be moved again. For example, we can start by placing the first coin on point 6 and then moving 
it to point 1 (denoted 6 → 1), where the coin will have to remain. We can continue, say, with the following 
sequence of moves: 7 → 2, 8 → 3, 7 → 4, 8 → 5, which places five coins.
